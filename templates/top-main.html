                <dd class="dd">history:<br />
                Mount Fuji is Japan’s highest and most iconic mountain, standing at 3,776 meters. 
                It is a stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707-1708. 
                Mount Fuji has been sacred in Japanese culture for centuries, inspiring Shinto and Buddhist practices, art, and literature. 
                During the Edo period (17th-19th centuries), climbing Fuji became a popular pilgrimage. 
                Today, Mount Fuji is a UNESCO World Heritage site, 
                a symbol of Japan, and a major destination for climbers and tourists worldwide.
