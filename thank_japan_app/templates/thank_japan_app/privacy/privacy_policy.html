    <h1 class="category-header">Privacy Policy</h1>


    <p>ThankJapan ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it when you use our website and services, including our games.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Account Information:** When you register for our games, we collect your chosen username and a hashed (encrypted) version of your password. We do not store your password in plain text.</li>
        <li>**Game Data:** We collect your game scores and progress to provide game functionality, leaderboards, and to enhance your gaming experience.</li>
        <li>**Contact Information (if voluntarily provided):** If you contact us via email or a contact form, we collect your name and email address solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not use this information for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</li>
        <li>**Payment-Related Information (for voluntary contributions):** If you choose to make a voluntary contribution (support), payment processing is handled securely by Stripe. We do not directly collect or store your credit card details on our servers.</li>
        <li>**Technical Data (for website improvement):** We collect limited technical data such as your IP address, browser type, device information, and anonymous usage data (via cookies) to understand how our website is used and to improve its performance and user experience. This data is generally aggregated and anonymized, making it difficult to identify individual users directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your user account for our games.</li>
        <li>To enable you to log in and play games, save your progress, and display your scores on leaderboards.</li>
        <li>To respond to your inquiries and messages.</li>
        <li>To process voluntary contributions securely through Stripe.</li>
        <li>To analyze website and game usage patterns (anonymously and in aggregate) and improve our website's functionality, content, and user experience.</li>
        <li>To ensure the security and stability of our website and games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>All payment transactions for voluntary contributions are processed securely by our trusted third-party payment processor, Stripe. We do not store your credit card details on our servers. This means your sensitive payment information is handled directly by Stripe in compliance with industry security standards.</p>
    <p>Please refer to <a class="anchor" href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how they handle your data.</p>

    <h2 id="cookie-settings">4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies primarily to enhance your browsing experience, enable game login functionality, remember your preferences, and anonymously analyze site traffic to understand how our website and games are used. Cookies are small data files stored on your device.</p>
    <p>Specifically, we use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> Essential for the website and game login to function properly (e.g., maintaining your session, remembering cookie consent).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical/Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies, often provided by services like Google Analytics, help us count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. This information is collected in an aggregated and anonymous form, meaning we cannot directly identify you. For more information on Google's privacy practices, please visit <a class="anchor" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use cookies for targeted advertising or extensive user profiling. You can control cookie settings through your browser preferences. Most web browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences, including refusing cookies or deleting certain cookies. Please note that if you choose to turn off strictly necessary cookies, some features of our website and game functionality may not work correctly.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We share information only in very limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With trusted third-party service providers (e.g., Stripe for payment processing, Google Analytics for anonymized site analysis) when absolutely necessary to operate our service. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.</li>
        <li>When required by law or a valid legal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information, including your account data and game scores, from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. This includes using hashing for passwords and striving to use industry-standard security practices to safeguard your data.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information and game data. You can delete your account and associated data at any time through your game's user settings or by contacting us via email. If you would like to exercise these rights, please contact us via email. Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under applicable data protection laws.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
