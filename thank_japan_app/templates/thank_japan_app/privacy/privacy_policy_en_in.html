    <h1 class="category-header">Privacy Policy</h1>


    <p>ThankJapan (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it when you use our website and services, including our games.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Account Information:** When you register for our games, we collect the username you choose and a hashed (encrypted) version of your password. We do not store passwords in plain text.</li>
        <li>**Game Data:** We collect game scores and progress to provide game functionality, leaderboards, and enhance your gaming experience.</li>
        <li>**Contact Information (Voluntarily Provided):** If you contact us via email or our inquiry form, we collect your name and email address solely to respond to your inquiry. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</li>
        <li>**Payment-Related Information (for Voluntary Support):** If you choose to provide voluntary support, payment processing is securely handled by PayPal. We do not directly collect or store your credit card information on our servers.</li>
        <li>**Technical Data (for Website Improvement):** We collect limited technical data such as your IP address, browser type, device information, and anonymized usage data (via cookies) to understand how our website is used and to improve its performance and user experience. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized, making it difficult to directly identify individual users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your game account.</li>
        <li>To enable you to log in and play games, save your progress, and display your scores on leaderboards.</li>
        <li>To respond to your inquiries and messages.</li>
        <li>To securely process voluntary support through PayPal.</li>
        <li>To analyze website and game usage patterns (in an anonymized and aggregated form) to improve website functionality, content, and user experience.</li>
        <li>To ensure the security and stability of our website and games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>All payment transactions for voluntary support are securely processed by PayPal, a trusted third-party payment processor. We do not store your credit card information on our servers. This means your sensitive payment information is handled directly by PayPal in compliance with industry security standards.</p>
    <p>For more information on how PayPal handles your data, please refer to <a class="anchor" href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="cookie-settings">4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>We primarily use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your browsing experience, enable game login functionality, remember your preferences, and anonymously analyze site traffic to understand how our website and games are being used. Cookies are small data files stored on your device.</p>
    <p>Specifically, we use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> Essential for the proper functioning of the website and game login (e.g., maintaining sessions, remembering cookie consent).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics/Performance Cookies:</strong> Provided by services like Google Analytics, these cookies help us count visits and traffic sources, allowing us to measure and improve our site's performance. This information is collected in an aggregated and anonymized form, making it impossible to directly identify you. For more details on Google's privacy practices, please see <a class="anchor" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use cookies for targeted advertising or extensive user profiling. You can manage your cookie settings through your browser preferences. Most web browsers allow you to control cookie settings, including rejecting cookies or deleting specific cookies. Please note that if you choose to turn off strictly necessary cookies, some features of our website and game functionality may not work correctly.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share information in very limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With trusted third-party service providers (e.g., PayPal for payment processing, Google Analytics for anonymized site analysis) when absolutely necessary to operate our services. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.</li>
        <li>When required by law or valid legal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information, account data, game scores, and other data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. This includes hashing passwords and making efforts to use industry-standard security practices to safeguard your data.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information and game data. You can delete your account and associated data at any time through your game user settings or by contacting us via email. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us by email. Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under applicable data protection laws.</p>

If there are significant changes, we will notify you by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
